# Debian Base Setup

This provisioning helps bringing the remote debian machines (e.g. Raspberry Pis or Rock64 or other debian systems) into a homogenized state that guarantees:

- accessability
- low energy consumption from unused interfaces
- security.

## Pre-Requirements

### Operating Systems

The following is just an exemplary list.
Feel free to try your own **debian-based** system.

- Ubuntu Server (http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/) or Debian (https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/)
- Debain (Ayufan Rock64 Build) for Rock64 (https://github.com/ayufan-rock64/linux-build/ or http://wiki.pine64.org/index.php/ROCK64_Main_Page)
- Raspbian Lite for Raspberry Pis

### SSH

After a fresh OS-flashing, make sure that the remote devices are accessible via ssh (on *Raspbian*, e.g. place an empty file called `ssh` into the `/boot/`-directory) and that your ssh-id is introduced.
To create your SSH key consult a search-engine of your choice and create a key **with** passphrase.
You'll need to discover the IPs of the devices with e.g. your router management interface, arp-scan or wireshark (please consult the web for this).
To achieve that, please execute from your local control machine for every host in the setup:

- `ssh-copy-id {USERNAME, e.g. pi}@{IP-ADDRESS, e.g. 192.168.1.150}` and verify with the default password e.g. `raspberry` or `rock64`

Make sure to repeat this process for **every** machine.
After this process is done, have a look at `inventory/hosts.ini`-file and verify the entries.

After this step, the remote machines are almost ready to be provisioned by Ansible.
We just need to set our variables accordingly, namely our public ssh-keys.

For this create a file `inventory/group_vars/all/vault.yml` and paste your public key/s (get it e.g. via `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`) into this file.
See `inventory/group_vars/all/vault.example.yml` for the format.
Encrypt the `vault`-file with your public keys by following the subsequent section.

## How to de-/encrypt a vault-file

This setup deals with data, that we better not log into our version control system in an unencrypted manner.
To protect sensible data from being unintendedly exposed to unauthorized third parties, we use the Ansible best practices:

1. prefix sensitive variables with `vault_`, e.g. `vault_public_keys`
2. create a file dedicated for encryption, e.g. `vault` on the same directory level.
3. reference that prefixed variable (`vault_public_keys`) inside this vault.
4. Create a secure token and paste it into the `.vault.key`-file (which is referenced in the ansible.cfg) and encrypt the `vault`-file with e.g. the following command:   
   `ansible-vault encrypt inventory/group_vars/all/vault.yml` (assuming your command line is on project root).
5. To decrypt the file use `decrypt` instead of `encrypt`.

## How to use this Ansible playbook

After all the inventory and variable and vault-files under `inventory/group_vars/all` have been examined and changed accordingly, execute the following command:

```bash
ansible-playbook playbooks/provisioning.yml -k
```

You'll be prompted for your **ssh passphrase** and the process beginns.
For issues with Ansible or the connection, please consult an online search engine of your choice.
